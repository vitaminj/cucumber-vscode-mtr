Feature: Cucumber Extension Test
    As a VSCode user
    I would like seamless integration with Cucumber tests and definitions

Scenario: A Test
    Given a step is invoked
    When a CaSe InSeNsItIvE step is invoked
    Then a step with A and 5 as its letter and number of the day is invoked for fun
